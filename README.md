# playApp
//Weather App that tells kids if the weather is good enough to go play outside
//This is made to run using node/express (mostly just to show the range of my knowledge)

you can test the app by just opening the HTML in the browser

to start the server, run "npm start" in your terminal (local host: 7000 in your browser)
